Abstract Data Types in C++
Created by Matthew Chesser (github: chesserm)

This is a repository I made for my implementations of the Abstract Data Types that I have learned so far. As I learn about a new ADT, whether it be from one of my classes or from independent learning, I want to practice implementing it in order to solidify my understanding of that particular ADT.

Additionally, this gives me a resource to use for personal projects, if I choose to use one of these ADTs. As a result, all of the implementations are in header files so they can be easily included into other projects.

ADTs currently in this repository:
    - Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List
    - Binary Search Tree

I will continue to add to this repository as I learn more Abstract Data Types, or as I think of a helpful function to add to a pre-existing implementation.
