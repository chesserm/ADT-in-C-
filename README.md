Abstract Data Types in C++
Created by Matthew Chesser (github: chesserm)



This is a repository I made for my implementations of the Abstract Data Types that I have learned so far. As I learn about a new ADT, whether it be from one of my classes or from independent learning, I want to practice implementing it in order to solidify my understanding of that particular ADT.



Additionally, this gives me a resource to use for personal projects, if I choose to use one of these ADTs. As a result, all of the implementations are in header files so they can be easily included into other projects.



ADTs currently in this repository:


  - Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Binary Search Tree*


I will continue to add to this repository as I learn more Abstract Data Types, or as I think of a helpful function to add to a pre-existing implementation.

*If you want to undesrtand conceptually how Binary Search Tree recursion works, see the file in the repo titled "BST Recursion Explained.txt". In which, I do my best to explain BST recursion throught the printInOrder() function.
